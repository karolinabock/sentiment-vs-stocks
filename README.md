# sentiment-vs-stocks

## Project Overview

This project analyzes whether the sentiment of market news published on [MKT News](https://mktnews.com/index.html) influences the stock prices of AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN over the last 6 months. These three stocks were selected for testing purposes, but the pipeline is easily extendable to analyze other stocks by modifying the input symbol list.

## Objective

The goal is to examine correlations between market sentiment (expressed in news) and stock price changes using NLP sentiment analysis, financial data, and a Power BI dashboard.

## How to Run

1. Create virtual environment and install requirements(Python Packages):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set environment variables in `.env` (e.g., `DATABASE_URL=`)
3. Set stock symbols in data/raw/stock names.txt AS "AAPL;Apple"
4. Run the pipeline:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

4. Open `sentiment_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI and connect to PostgreSQL

## Core Logic

- **Cutoff time**: news after 10:00 PM is assigned to the next trading session
- **Trading days only**: weekends and holidays are excluded, news are assigned to next session day
- **Sentiment**: classified as `positive`, `neutral`, or `negative` + compound score from VADER

## SQL Views <WIP>

This project generates several PostgreSQL views:

- `daily_sentiment` - daily average sentiment
- `stock_changes` - daily stock price changes (%)
- `sentiment_vs_stock` - merged sentiment + stock changes
- `joined_data` - view for Power BI

## Power BI Visualizations <WIP>

- Stock price vs sentiment over time
- Count of positive/negative news
- Correlation between sentiment changes and stock performance

## Outcome & Future Work

- Future extension: ML classifier to detect stock-specific impact of news
