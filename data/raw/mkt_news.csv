2025-05-22 17:24:21,"The U.S. Senate voted 51-44 to repeal California’s plan to ban new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035, overturning a Biden-era EPA waiver that allowed stricter state-level emissions standards. The bill, backed by Republicans and industry groups, now heads to President Trump, who is expected to sign it. Critics argue the repeal undermines state authority and weakens climate efforts, while supporters claim it protects jobs and consumer choice. Democrats condemned the use of a procedural workaround that bypassed Senate rules, warning it sets a dangerous precedent. The move could reshape national clean car policies going forward."

These “xStocks” will trade 24/7 on the Solana blockchain and be backed by real shares held by Kraken’s partner, Backed Finance, with tokens redeemable for the underlying securities’ cash value.
The offering includes major stocks such as Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia, as well as ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). U.S. customers will not have access to the service.
Kraken says xStocks aim to give international investors a cheaper, faster alternative to traditional brokerage routes, which often involve high fees and delays. The tokens may also be moved into personal digital wallets or used on other crypto platforms. Eventually, investors could even use them as collateral for crypto trading."

2025-05-22 12:20:58,"Country Garden Holdings has secured support from nearly 75% of its offshore bondholders for a proposed debt restructuring, according to sources familiar with the matter, ahead of a court hearing on potential liquidation next week.
To proceed under Hong Kong’s “scheme of arrangement” process, the plan requires backing from 75% of total creditors and majorities within each creditor group. While bondholder approval is nearly in place, a key group of bank creditors—the coordination committee—has not yet agreed to the proposal, the sources said.
The company faces a winding-up hearing on Monday as it seeks to finalize one of the largest restructurings by a Chinese developer since the property crisis began. Country Garden has been negotiating with offshore bondholders since defaulting over 18 months ago and is seeking to restructure $14.1 billion in debt, including $10.3 billion in bond principal, per a January filing.
The company declined to comment."

2025-05-22 08:40:34,"OPEC+ is deliberating a potential production increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July, triple the initially planned amount, marking the third consecutive month of elevated output. The decision, to be finalized at the June 1 meeting, follows similar increases in May and June aimed at curbing quota violations and stabilizing prices.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC+’s leader, has warned overproducing members of further hikes if compliance issues persist. The group’s unexpected supply boosts, coinciding with the U.S.-China trade war in April, initially drove oil prices to a four-year low near $60 per barrel in London. However, prices have since recovered, with Brent crude trading just below $65 on Thursday as tariff tensions eased.
Despite this rebound, market sentiment remains bearish. The International Energy Agency recently forecasted slower global oil demand growth for the remainder of 2025 due to economic challenges, following a strong first quarter."

2025-05-22 08:17:17,"Goldman Sachs continues to hold a positive view of Pony AI, primarily due to the company's significant expansion in robotaxi operations, which is supported by ongoing business enhancements and technological advancements, according to a recent analyst note. The company's robotaxi services are scaling up rapidly, with fare-charging revenue in the first quarter increasing by 800% year-over-year. This aligns with Goldman Sachs' expectations that recurring revenues will play a larger role in contributing to a more stable performance in future quarters.
Goldman Sachs believes that Pony AI's latest generation of robotaxis is likely to attract a greater number of potential users, thanks to improved cost efficiency and an expanded fleet size. As a result, Goldman Sachs has maintained its ""buy"" rating on Pony AI's stock and has raised its target price from $23.10 to $26.00. The stock last closed at $17.29."

2025-05-22 06:38:28,"According to a research note from Citi analysts, Baidu's advertising business is likely to drag the company's overall performance in the next few quarters. The analysts anticipate a 10% year-on-year decline in core advertising revenues in both the second and third quarters. They believe that share prices are unlikely to be re-rated before core advertising revenue returns to positive growth. While expecting the cloud margin to remain stable at a low double-digit level, the analysts note that investments in AI and disruptions to search advertising revenue will negatively impact Baidu's core operating margin in the coming quarters. Despite these challenges, the analysts maintain a buy rating, citing an attractive valuation. Citi has slightly reduced its target price for Baidu's ADRs to US$138.00 from US$139.00."

It is expected that BIDU-SW's cloud business will maintain at least around 25% growth in 2Q25, outperforming its peers. Goldman Sachs lowered BIDU-SW's 2025-2027 EPADS by 4-6% due to profit margin pressure given a shift in revenue mix, AI investment and weaker advertising revenue, although these are partially offset by a better outlook for cloud business revenue. Therefore, the broker dropped its target prices for BIDU-SW's H-shares/US stock to $94/US$96 each, with rating kept at Buy."

2025-05-22 05:24:49,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed plans to staff for a revolutionary AI device developed with former Apple designer Jony Ive. The project aims to ship 100 million unobtrusive AI “companions” that integrate seamlessly into users’ lives, potentially adding $1 trillion in value to OpenAI. Unlike smartphones or wearables, the device will be aware of its surroundings and designed to reduce screen dependence. Altman emphasized the importance of stealth to prevent competitors from replicating the product prematurely. Ive described the collaboration as inspiring, likening it to his work with Steve Jobs. The $6.5 billion acquisition of Ive’s startup, io, will accelerate development, with the first device expected by late 2026. Altman envisions a “family of devices” that redefines human-AI interaction, moving beyond traditional hardware paradigms. Despite OpenAI’s financial challenges and competition from tech giants like Apple and Google, Altman sees this device as central to OpenAI’s future. He noted that existing technology fails to fully realize AI’s potential, positioning this project as a transformative step for the company and the industry."

2025-05-22 04:42:03,"Two members of Barclays' FICC Research team pointed out in a research report that the soaring yields of super-long Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) reflect a structural lack of demand from the Japanese private sector. They also mentioned that position adjustments and long-term fiscal concerns could be contributing factors to the yield surge. According to them, the super-long sector is unlikely to stabilize until the structural supply-demand imbalance improves. In the absence of sufficient demand from private investors, any adjustments to the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) quantitative tightening and/or JGB issuance are likely to become the focus of attention."

""The threat of military strikes against Iran cannot be ruled out, which raises the stakes if U.S.-Iran talks remain deadlocked,"" the analyst noted. Dhar pointed out that safe-haven demand will probably favor gold more than in the past, as the precious metal has outperformed both the USD and Treasurys following the increase in U.S. tariffs.
